# Self-Driving-Cars-specialization-
Self-driving cars specialization by the University of Toronto - Coursera
The specialization covers various aspects, including perception, control, localization, and mapping. Participants learn about key concepts like sensor integration, machine learning, computer vision, and motion planning. The specialization combines theory with practical hands-on assignments and projects, providing students with the skills and knowledge needed to understand and contribute to the field of self-driving cars.

# The first course "Introduction to Self-Driving Cars"
Offered as part of the University of Toronto's self-driving car specialization on Coursera, provides a foundational overview of autonomous vehicle technology. It covers essential concepts such as sensors, perception, control systems, and the overall architecture of self-driving cars. Through a combination of theoretical explanations and practical assignments, students gain insight into the components that make up self-driving systems and the challenges they entail. This course serves as a starting point for individuals looking to enter the field of self-driving cars, offering a clear understanding of the core principles and technologies involved.

# The second course "State Estimation and Localization" 
Delves into advanced topics related to autonomous vehicle technology. This course focuses on techniques and algorithms for accurately determining the vehicle's position and orientation in the environment. Students learn about sensor fusion, probabilistic methods, and mapping using sensor data. Through practical assignments and projects, participants gain hands-on experience in implementing these techniques, enabling them to develop a strong foundation in state estimation and localization for self-driving cars. This course equips students with the skills necessary to solve real-world challenges in navigation and perception within autonomous driving systems.
